Usage Of Content

THE ECLIPSE FOUNDATION MAKES AVAILABLE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION
AND/OR OTHER MATERIALS FOR OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS (COLLECTIVELY &quot;CONTENT&quot;). USE OF
THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED
BELOW. BY USING THE CONTENT, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED
BY THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE
AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY
APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU
MAY NOT USE THE CONTENT.

Applicable Licenses

Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the Eclipse Foundation
is provided to you under the terms and conditions of the Eclipse Public License
Version 2.0 (&quot;EPL&quot;). A copy of the EPL is provided with this Content and is also
available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0. For purposes of the EPL,
&quot;Program&quot; will mean the Content.

Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object code, documentation
and other files maintained in the Eclipse Foundation source code repository
(&quot;Repository&quot;) in software modules (&quot;Modules&quot;) and made available as
downloadable archives (&quot;Downloads&quot;).

-   Content may be structured and packaged into modules to facilitate
    delivering, extending, and upgrading the Content. Typical modules may
    include plug-ins (&quot;Plug-ins&quot;), plug-in fragments (&quot;Fragments&quot;), and
    features (&quot;Features&quot;).
-   Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or JAR
    (Java\u2122 ARchive) in a directory named &quot;plugins&quot;.
-   A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and
    associated material. Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory in a
    directory named &quot;features&quot;. Within a Feature, files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may
    contain a list of the names and version numbers of the Plug-ins and/or
    Fragments associated with that Feature.
-   Features may also include other Features (&quot;Included Features&quot;). Within a
    Feature, files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and
    version numbers of Included Features.

The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be contained in
files named &quot;about.html&quot; (&quot;Abouts&quot;). The terms and conditions governing Features
and Included Features should be contained in files named &quot;license.html&quot;
(&quot;Feature Licenses&quot;). Abouts and Feature Licenses may be located in any
directory of a Download or Module including, but not limited to the following
locations:

-   The top-level (root) directory
-   Plug-in and Fragment directories
-   Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs
-   Sub-directories of the directory named &quot;src&quot; of certain Plug-ins
-   Feature directories

Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is installed using
the Provisioning Technology (as defined below), you must agree to a license
(&quot;Feature Update License&quot;) during the installation process. If the Feature
contains Included Features, the Feature Update License should either provide you
with the terms and conditions governing the Included Features or inform you
where you can locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be found in the &quot;license&quot;
property of files named &quot;feature.properties&quot; found within a Feature. Such
Abouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms and
conditions (or references to such terms and conditions) that govern your use of
the associated Content in that directory.

THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY REFER TO THE EPL
OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS. SOME OF THESE
OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO):

-   Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 (available at
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html)
-   Eclipse Distribution License Version 1.0 (available at
    http://www.eclipse.org/licenses/edl-v1.0.html)
-   Common Public License Version 1.0 (available at
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html)

-   Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (available at

IT IS YOUR OBLIGATION TO READ AND ACCEPT ALL SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS PRIOR TO
USE OF THE CONTENT. If no About, Feature License, or Feature Update License is
provided, please contact the Eclipse Foundation to determine what terms and
conditions govern that particular Content.

Use of Provisioning Technology

The Eclipse Foundation makes available provisioning software, examples of which
include, but are not limited to, p2 and the Eclipse Update Manager
(&quot;Provisioning Technology&quot;) for the purpose of allowing users to install
software, documentation, information and/or other materials (collectively
&quot;Installable Software&quot;). This capability is provided with the intent of allowing
such users to install, extend and update Eclipse-based products. Information
about packaging Installable Software is available at
http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html (&quot;Specification&quot;).

You may use Provisioning Technology to allow other parties to install
Installable Software. You shall be responsible for enabling the applicable
license agreements relating to the Installable Software to be presented to, and
accepted by, the users of the Provisioning Technology in accordance with the
Specification. By using Provisioning Technology in such a manner and making it
available in accordance with the Specification, you further acknowledge your
agreement to, and the acquisition of all necessary rights to permit the
following:

1.  A series of actions may occur (&quot;Provisioning Process&quot;) in which a user may
    execute the Provisioning Technology on a machine (&quot;Target Machine&quot;) with the
    intent of installing, extending or updating the functionality of an
    Eclipse-based product.
2.  During the Provisioning Process, the Provisioning Technology may cause third
    party Installable Software or a portion thereof to be accessed and copied to
    the Target Machine.
3.  Pursuant to the Specification, you will provide to the user the terms and
    conditions that govern the use of the Installable Software (&quot;Installable
    Software Agreement&quot;) and such Installable Software Agreement shall be
    accessed from the Target Machine in accordance with the Specification. Such
    Installable Software Agreement must inform the user of the terms and
    conditions that govern the Installable Software and must solicit acceptance
    by the end user in the manner prescribed in such Installable
    Software Agreement. Upon such indication of agreement by the user, the
    provisioning Technology will complete installation of the
    Installable Software.

Cryptography

Content may contain encryption software. The country in which you are currently
may have restrictions on the import, possession, and use, and/or re-export to
another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any encryption software,
please check the country&apos;s laws, regulations and policies concerning the import,
possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to see if this is
permitted.
