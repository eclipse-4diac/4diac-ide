<h1 id="topOfPage">Setting up MinGW-w64</h1>

<h2>Install MinGW-w64</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.mingw-w64.org/" target="_blank">MinGW-w64</a> comprises development tools for compiling and debugging. 
Download the Mingw-w64 Installer from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/" target="_blank">here</a> and follow the steps in the wizard. 
It is essential that the installation path does not contain any spaces.
Therefore, you cannot install MinGW-w64 in Program Files.
We recommend to create a folder mingw-w64 on your system drive (e.g., C:\mingw).
Install a current version and specify <span class="button4diac">win32</span> as thread when requested.
Additionally, choose the architecture <span class="button4diac">x86_64</span>.</p>

<p>After installing, you need to edit the PATH variable. 
You can access the System Control Center by pressing <span class="button4diac">Windows Key + Pause</span>. 
In the System window, click <span class="button4diac">Advanced System Settings &rarr; Advanced (tab) &rarr; Environment Variables</span>. 
For Windows 10, a quick access is to enter "Edit the system environment variables" in the Start Search of Windows and click the button "Environment Variables".
Change the PATH variable (double-click on it or Select and <span class="button4diac">Edit</span>), and add the path where your MinGW-w64 has been installed to e.g., <span class="folderLocation">C:\mingw\mingw64\bin</span>. 
This folder should contain a number of .exe-files that you can see in your Explorer.</p> 

<h2>Test MinGW-w64</h2>
<p>Open the command prompt of Windows either via the Program Menu or type <span class="button4diac">cmd</span> in the Start Search of Windows. 
Enter:
<div class="code"><span class="inlineCode">g++ --version</div>
If version information of the compiler is displayed, it was successful and you can continue with the next section. </p>

<p>If you get an error such as "Command g++ not found", then something went wrong.
In this case, verify that the PATH variable was successfully set and directs to the correct installation path.
Additionally, open a new command prompt and try to execute the command again.
If you try to reinstall, do not forget to restart the command prompt again (it does not update automatically).
If this does not help, please ask for advice in the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=thread&frm_id=308">Forum</a>.
</p>

<h2>Change name of the make executable</h2>

<p>In your installation folder, inside the <span class="folderLocation">bin</span> directory, you should find a file called <span class="fileLocation">mingw32-make.exe</span>. 
Create a copy of the file in the same directory named <span class="fileLocation">make.exe</span>. 
This is because this file is the one you will use to compile 4diac FORTE, and "make" is the command used for that throughout the documentation.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>Now that you successfully installed a compiler, you can continue with the next step of the <a href="../../html/installation/install.html#FORTEsteps">installation tutorial</a>.
All information in the installation tutorial is based on a setup with MinGW-w64.
For users with previous experience in building a 4diac FORTE, the details are listed:
<ul>
	<li>When generating files for compiling in CMake, the tool "Unix Makefiles" has to be selected.</li>
	<li>Also the architecture option needs to be set in CMake: The correct FORTE_ARCHITECTURE is Win32</li>
	<li>When compiling, open the Windows command line and go to the folder, where CMake built the binaries.
	    Execute the command make to compile.</li>
</ul>
