<h1 id="topOfPage">Setting up Cygwin</h1>
<h2>Install Cygwin</h2>

<p>In Windows, Cygwin provides the necessary tools and libraries for building and debugging. 
Download Cygwin <a href="http://cygwin.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
During installation, consider that there should not be any blanks in the folder names of the installation. 
Follow the instructions of the installation wizard and choose at least the following packages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>binutils</li>
	<li>make</li>
	<li>gcc</li>
	<li>gdb</li>
</ul>

<h2>Set Environment Variables</h2>

<p>After installing, you need to edit the PATH variable. 
You can access the System Control Center by pressing <span class="button4diac">Windows Key + Pause</span>. 
In the System window, click <span class="button4diac">Advanced System Settings &rarr; Advanced (tab) &rarr; Environment Variables</span>. 
For Windows 10, a quick access is to enter "Edit the system environment variables" in the Start Search of Windows and click the button "Environment Variables".
Change the PATH variable (double-click on it or Select and <span class="button4diac">Edit</span>), and add the path where your Cywgwin is, e.g. <span class="folderLocation">C:\cygwin\bin</span>.</p>

<h2>Test Cygwin</h2>
<p>Open the command prompt of Windows either via the Program Menu or type cmd in the Start Search of Windows. 
    Enter <span class="inlineCode">bash</span>. 
    If the bash prompt appears as shown in the picture below, it was successful. 
    To end Cygwin enter <span class="inlineCode">exit</span>, then enter <span class="inlineCode">exit</span> again to end the command prompt.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>Now that you successfully installed a compiler, you can continue with the next step of the <a href="../../html/installation/install.html#FORTEsteps">installation tutorial</a>.
All information in the installation tutorial is based on a setup with MinGW.
As you are using Cygwin, you need to keep in mind the following:
<ul>
	<li>When generating files for compiling in CMake, the tool "Unix Makefiles" has to be selected.
	    (Same tool as for the MinGW setup.)</li>
	<li><span class="specificText">The architecture option needs to be set in CMake: The correct FORTE_ARCHITECTURE is Posix</span></li>
	<li>When compiling, open Cygwin and go to the folder, where CMake built the binaries.
	    Execute the command make to compile.
<div class="code"> cd FORTE_FOLDER_ROOT/bin/[YOUR_SYSTEM]
 make</div></li>
</ul>
